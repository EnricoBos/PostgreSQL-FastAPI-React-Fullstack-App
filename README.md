# PostgreSQL-FastAPI-React-Fullstack-App
This repository contains a full-stack web application using FastAPI as the backend and React as the frontend. The backend is powered by a PostgreSQL database, which you can set up manually following the provided instructions.

The project is split into two main guides:

 -  Database Creation: Step-by-step guide on how to create a PostgreSQL database from scratch using WSL2 and Ubuntu. This database will be used by the application to store and retrieve data.

 -  App: Guide to set up and run the full-stack application that interacts with the database. It includes both backend logic (FastAPI) and frontend components (React).
